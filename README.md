# Michael Hanna Media Radar Assignment

### Consume Media Radar API
I decided to build an SDK for MediaRadar Publications Ads Web services. The SDK was designed to be flexible to allow developers to add more Request types. Each request should have domain objects within the Models folder and an instance of the Request in the PublicationAdsAPI facade class.

### The Backend
The web application is built on top of .NET Core 2.2 MVC utilizing dependency injections of the MediaRadar API SDK PublicationAdsAPI. 
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take the exercise a shot.

### Front End
Two apps .. ASP.NET MVVC Core 2.2 and Angular6 apps which consume the same endpoint.

### Prerequisites
VS 2018, .Net Core 2.2, Angular 6 CLI


### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelmedo/mrassignment.git
